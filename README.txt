# eleksmaker-inkscape-extension

This is a fork of the "EleksMaker Tool" Inkscape extension, with updates
to make it work on Inkscape 0.92.4 without weird scaling effects.

There are actually two plugins as part of EleksMaker Tool - the cutter
("Gcode output") and the hatcher ("Filling Gcode"), the former looking
like it's derived from the regular Gcode tools, and the latter appearing
to be from egg-bot. I have yet to try the hatcher, so I can offer no
comments as to whether it has scaling issues (but I didn't see the magic
values to indicate that it has issues, for what it's worth).
